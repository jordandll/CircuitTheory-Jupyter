    "# High Pass Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "A high-pass filterâ€™s task is just the opposite of a low-pass filter: to offer easy passage of a high-frequency signal and difficult passage to a low-frequency signal.  Unsuprisingly, the design of a capacitive high pass filter is the same as an inductive low pass filter, except with the inductor being replaced by a capacitor.  The same duality exists between an inductive high pass filter and a capacitive low pass filter;  An inductive high pass filter is the same as a capacitive low pass filter, except with the capacitor being replaced by an inductor."
