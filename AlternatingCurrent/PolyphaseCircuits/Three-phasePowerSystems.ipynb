    "## What are Split-Phase Power Systems?\n",
    "\n",
    "Split-phase power systems achieve their high conductor efficiency and low safety risk by splitting up the total voltage into lesser parts and powering multiple loads at those lesser voltages while drawing currents at levels typical of a full-voltage system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique, by the way, works just as well for DC power systems as it does for single-phase AC systems. Such systems are usually referred to as three-wire systems rather than split-phase because “phase” is a concept restricted to AC.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we know from our experience with vectors and complex numbers that AC voltages don’t always add up as we think they would if they are out of phase with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "This principle, applied to power systems, can be put to use to make power systems with even greater conductor efficiencies and lower shock hazard than with split-phase."
