    "One might wonder if we’ve lost all the advantages of three-phase power here, given the fact that we have such greater conductor currents, necessitating thicker, more costly wire.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is no. Although this circuit would require three number 1 gauge copper conductors (at 1000 feet of distance between source and load this equates to a little over 750 pounds of copper for the whole system), it is still less than the 1000+ pounds of copper required for a single-phase system delivering the same power (30 kW) at the same voltage (120 volts conductor-to-conductor).\n",
    "\n",
    "One distinct advantage of a Δ-connected system is its lack of a neutral wire. With a Y-connected system, a neutral wire was needed in case one of the phase loads were to fail open (or be turned off), in order to keep the phase voltages at the load from changing.\n",

    "This is not necessary (or even possible!) in a Δ-connected circuit.\n",

    "With each load phase element directly connected across a respective source phase winding, the phase voltage will be constant regardless of open failures in the load elements.\n",
