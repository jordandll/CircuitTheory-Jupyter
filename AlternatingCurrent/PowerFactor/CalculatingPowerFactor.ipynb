    "\n",
    "Power factor can be an important aspect to consider in an AC circuit because of any power factor less than 1 means that the circuit’s wiring has to carry more current than what would be necessary with zero reactance in the circuit to deliver the same amount of (true) power to the resistive load.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our last example circuit had been purely resistive, we would have been able to deliver a full 169.256 watts to the load with the same 1.410 amps of current, rather than the mere 119.365 watts that it is presently dissipating with that same current quantity.\n",

    "## Poor Power Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "Poor power factor can be corrected, paradoxically, by adding another load to the circuit drawing an equal and opposite amount of reactive power, to cancel out the effects of the load’s inductive reactance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inductive reactance can only be canceled by capacitive reactance, so we have to add a capacitor in parallel to our example circuit as the additional load.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of these two opposing reactances in parallel is to bring the circuit’s total impedance equal to its total resistance (to make the impedance phase angle equal, or at least closer, to zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we know that the (uncorrected) reactive power is 119.998 VAR (inductive), we need to calculate the correct capacitor size to produce the same quantity of (capacitive) reactive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this capacitor will be directly in parallel with the source (of known voltage), we’ll use the power formula which starts from voltage and reactance:"
