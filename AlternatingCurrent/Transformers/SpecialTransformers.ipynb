    "Because transformers can step voltage and current to different levels, and because power is transferred equivalently between primary and secondary windings, they can be used to “convert” the impedance of a load to a different level. That last phrase deserves some explanation, so let’s investigate what it means.\n",

    "The purpose of a load (usually) is to do something productive with the power it dissipates. In the case of a resistive heating element, the practical purpose for the power dissipated is to heat something up.\n",

    "Both heaters dissipate exactly 1000 watts of power, but they do so at different voltage and current levels (either 250 volts and 4 amps, or 125 volts and 8 amps). Using Ohm’s Law to determine the necessary resistance of these heating elements ($R=E/I$), we arrive at figures of 62.5 Ω and 15.625 Ω, respectively.\n",

With 62.5 Ω of impedance (resistance), the current would only be 2 amps ($I=E\\div R$; $125\\div62.5$), and the power dissipation would only be 250 watts (P=IE; 125 x 2), or one-quarter of its rated power.\n",
